# FraiseQL Doctor: Agent Handoff Guide
**For launching fresh agents for each release phase**

## üéØ Project Overview

**Current State:** Development complete with 100% test success (168/168), solid architecture, but needs security fixes, CLI implementation, and documentation for production release.

**Goal:** Transform FraiseQL Doctor from excellent development foundation to production-ready v1.0.0 release.

## üìã Phase Execution Instructions

### Phase 1: Security & Stability
**Target:** Fix all security issues and implement production logging
**Timeline:** 3-5 days
**Agent Prompt:**
```
Implement Phase 1 security fixes for FraiseQL Doctor. The project currently has 100% test success but 45 security warnings that must be fixed before release. Focus on:

1. Replace MD5 hashing with secure alternatives (Blake2b/SHA-256)
2. Eliminate unsafe pickle deserialization  
3. Use cryptographically secure random generation
4. Fix silent exception handling with proper logging
5. Implement production-grade logging infrastructure

Follow the detailed implementation plan in PHASE1_SECURITY.md. Maintain 100% test success rate throughout all changes. The codebase has excellent TDD foundation - leverage existing test infrastructure.

Key files to modify:
- src/fraiseql_doctor/core/result_storage.py (MD5 and pickle issues)
- src/fraiseql_doctor/services/retry.py (random generation)
- Multiple test files (silent exception handling)
- New: src/fraiseql_doctor/utils/logging.py

Success criteria: Zero security warnings from `ruff check --select S .`
```

### Phase 2: CLI Implementation  
**Target:** Complete functional CLI interface
**Timeline:** 5-7 days
**Agent Prompt:**
```
Implement complete CLI functionality for FraiseQL Doctor. The project has solid backend architecture with 100% test success, but CLI commands are currently just placeholder stubs that do nothing.

Transform into a full-featured CLI tool with:

1. Query management (create, list, execute, update, delete)
2. Endpoint management (add, list, test, update, remove) 
3. Health monitoring (check, monitor, report, dashboard)
4. Batch operations (execute, import, export, schedule)
5. Rich terminal UX (progress bars, colors, interactive prompts)
6. File format support (GraphQL, JSON, YAML import/export)

Follow the detailed implementation plan in PHASE2_CLI.md. The backend modules (query_collection, execution_manager, result_storage, fraiseql_client) are fully implemented - wire them into CLI commands.

Key files to create/modify:
- src/fraiseql_doctor/cli/commands/ (new directory structure)
- src/fraiseql_doctor/cli/main.py (replace placeholder stubs)
- tests/cli/ (comprehensive CLI testing)

Success criteria: All CLI commands functional with rich UX
```

### Phase 3: Documentation & Release
**Target:** Production-ready documentation and release process
**Timeline:** 5-7 days  
**Agent Prompt:**
```
Create comprehensive documentation and release preparation for FraiseQL Doctor v1.0.0. The project has solid technical foundation and complete CLI functionality - now needs user-facing documentation for production release.

Create complete documentation suite:

1. Enhanced README with clear value proposition and quick start
2. Installation guide for multiple methods (pip, pipx, Docker)
3. Complete user guide with workflows and examples  
4. CLI reference documentation for all commands
5. Developer documentation and contributing guide
6. Release automation pipeline with quality gates

Follow the detailed plan in PHASE3_DOCUMENTATION.md. Use the working CLI to generate examples and screenshots.

Key deliverables:
- docs/ directory with complete documentation site
- examples/ with real-world usage patterns
- .github/workflows/release.yml automation
- Updated README.md for production use

Success criteria: Complete documentation enabling new user adoption
```

## üîß Development Environment Setup

Each agent should start with this setup verification:

```bash
# Verify current state
cd /home/lionel/code/fraiseql_doctor
uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short  # Should show 168/168 passing
uv run ruff check --select S .      # Shows security issues to fix

# Development workflow  
make test     # Full test suite
make lint     # Code quality check
make build    # Package building
uv run fraiseql-doctor --help  # CLI testing
```

## üìä Quality Gates (Maintain Throughout)

**Never compromise on these standards:**
- **100% test success rate** (currently 168/168 tests)
- **High code coverage** (currently 81%, target 90%+)
- **Zero security warnings** (currently 45 to fix)
- **Clean linting** (ruff and mypy clean)
- **Performance benchmarks** (no regressions)

## üóÇÔ∏è Key Files Reference

**Phase-specific implementation guides:**
- `PHASE1_SECURITY.md` - Detailed security fix implementation
- `PHASE2_CLI.md` - Complete CLI implementation plan  
- `PHASE3_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Documentation and release preparation
- `RELEASE_PLAN.md` - Overall 3-phase strategy overview

**Core codebase (working, don't break):**
- `src/fraiseql_doctor/core/` - Business logic (excellent foundation)
- `tests/` - Comprehensive test suite (100% success, leverage this)
- `pyproject.toml` - Package configuration (proper modern setup)

**Current status files:**
- `LESSONS_LEARNED_TESTING_SUCCESS.md` - How project achieved 100% tests
- `PHASE4_REVERSE_TESTING_REPORT.md` - Testing methodology success

## üéØ Success Indicators

**Phase 1 Success:** `ruff check --select S .` shows zero warnings
**Phase 2 Success:** `fraiseql-doctor query list` works (not placeholder)  
**Phase 3 Success:** Fresh user can install and use tool from documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Maintain test success** - The 100% test success rate is the project's crown jewel
2. **Leverage existing architecture** - Don't rebuild, integrate with existing modules
3. **Follow TDD principles** - Tests first, implementation second (project's core strength)
4. **Security is non-negotiable** - Phase 1 fixes are release blockers
5. **User experience matters** - CLI should be delightful to use

## üöÄ Launch Commands

**For Phase 1:**
```bash
cat PHASE1_SECURITY.md  # Review detailed implementation plan
uv run ruff check --select S .  # See current security issues
```

**For Phase 2:**  
```bash
cat PHASE2_CLI.md  # Review CLI implementation plan
uv run fraiseql-doctor --help  # See current placeholder state
```

**For Phase 3:**
```bash
cat PHASE3_DOCUMENTATION.md  # Review documentation plan  
ls docs/  # See current empty documentation directory
```

**Each phase builds on the previous success. The project has exceptional technical quality - these phases complete the user-facing aspects for production readiness.**
