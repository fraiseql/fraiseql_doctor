## 🤖 **Command Processing Instructions**

When the user uses any `@claude` command from CLAUDE_COMMANDS.md, you should:

### **1. Command Recognition**
Recognize these command patterns:
- `@claude save idea: [DESCRIPTION]`
- `@claude add feature: [NAME] - [DESC] - [PRIORITY]`
- `@claude save feedback: [USER] said "[FEEDBACK]" - [CONTEXT]`
- `@claude research question: [QUESTION] - [WHY]`
- `@claude tech debt: [COMPONENT] - [ISSUE] - [IMPACT]`
- `@claude architecture: [DECISION] - [RATIONALE] - [ALTERNATIVES]`
- `@claude progress: [ITEM] - [STATUS] - [NOTES]`
- `@claude lesson: [LEARNING] - [CONTEXT] - [APPLICATION]`
- `@claude integration: [SERVICE] - [USE_CASE] - [PRIORITY]`
- `@claude competitor: [COMPETITOR] - [FEATURE] - [RESPONSE]`

### **2. Processing Steps**

For each command:

1. **✅ Acknowledge** - Confirm you received and understood the command
2. **📝 Edit ROADMAP.md** - Add the content to the appropriate section
3. **🏷️ Auto-categorize** - Determine the best section based on keywords:
   - Auth keywords → Authentication & Security
   - Monitor, alert, metrics → Advanced Monitoring & Analytics  
   - Query, GraphQL, schema → Query Intelligence & Optimization
   - UI, dashboard, user → User Experience & Collaboration
   - Integration, API → Integrations & Ecosystem
   - etc.
4. **⏰ Add metadata** - Include timestamp and any relevant context
5. **📊 Suggest priority** - Based on similar items and project phase
6. **✨ Confirm** - Summarize what was added and where

### **3. Response Format**

Use this template for command responses:

```
✅ [COMMAND_TYPE] processed!

📍 **Location**: ROADMAP.md > [SECTION] > [SUBSECTION]
🏷️ **Auto-categorized**: [CATEGORY TAGS]
⏰ **Added**: [TIMESTAMP]
🎯 **Suggested Priority**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] ([REASONING])
📝 **Summary**: [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]

[ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT_OR_SUGGESTIONS]
```

### **4. Auto-Categorization Rules**

**Keywords → Sections:**
- `auth, login, security, permission, role` → Authentication & Security
- `monitor, alert, metric, dashboard, health` → Advanced Monitoring & Analytics
- `query, GraphQL, schema, performance` → Query Intelligence & Optimization  
- `federation, service, environment` → Federation & Multi-Service Support
- `CI/CD, GitHub, deploy, container` → DevOps & CI/CD Integration
- `mobile, UI, user, collaboration` → User Experience & Collaboration
- `integration, API, webhook` → Integrations & Ecosystem
- `docs, tutorial, community` → Developer Experience & Learning
- `enterprise, compliance, audit` → Enterprise & Compliance

### **5. Priority Suggestion Guidelines**

**High Priority** (Critical for success):
- Core functionality gaps
- User-requested features with high impact
- Competitive differentiation opportunities
- Security/performance critical items

**Medium Priority** (Important but not urgent):
- Nice-to-have features with clear value
- Integration opportunities
- User experience improvements
- Developer productivity enhancements

**Low Priority** (Future consideration):
- Experimental or unvalidated ideas
- Minor quality-of-life improvements
- Features for niche use cases
- Advanced/power-user features

## 📚 **Context for Responses**

### **Current Project Status**
- ✅ Phase 1: Security & stability (complete)
- ✅ Phase 2: CLI functionality (complete)
- 🔄 Phase 2.5: Vue.js dashboard (in progress)
- 📋 Phase 3: Documentation (upcoming)

### **Key Architecture Decisions**
- Pluggable authentication (Auth0 default, easily swappable)
- Vue 3 + TypeScript frontend with bundle optimization
- Real-time WebSocket updates for dashboard
- TDD approach for all new features
- 62% bundle size reduction vs reference implementation

### **User Personas**
- DevOps Engineers (primary) - Need real-time monitoring and alerts
- Backend Developers - Need query performance insights
- Engineering Managers - Need team health overview and reporting

## 🎯 **Special Handling**

### **Idea Quality Assessment**
When processing ideas, consider:
- **Novelty**: Is this unique or already common?
- **Feasibility**: Technical complexity and effort
- **User Value**: Does it solve a real problem?
- **Strategic Fit**: Aligns with product vision?

### **Cross-Referencing**
When adding items, check for:
- Similar existing ideas that could be combined
- Related features that should be grouped
- Dependencies or prerequisites
- Competitive landscape implications

### **Research Question Handling**
For research questions, suggest:
- Potential research methods (user interviews, surveys, analytics)
- Validation approaches (prototypes, A/B tests)
- Success criteria for answers
- Timeline for investigation

## 🚀 **Example Processing**

**User Input:**
```
@claude save idea: Add GraphQL query complexity analysis to prevent expensive queries from overloading the server
```

**Expected Response:**
```
✅ Idea saved to roadmap!

📍 **Location**: ROADMAP.md > Query Intelligence & Optimization > Query Optimization Suggestions
🏷️ **Auto-categorized**: Query Intelligence, Performance, Security
⏰ **Added**: 2025-01-21 15:45
🎯 **Suggested Priority**: High (performance and security are critical for production GraphQL)
📝 **Summary**: GraphQL query complexity analysis for server protection

Great idea! This aligns perfectly with our query intelligence roadmap. I've placed it in "Query Optimization Suggestions" since it's directly related to the existing "Query complexity scoring with recommendations" item. This could be a key differentiator vs competitors and addresses a common GraphQL production concern.

💡 Consider: Integration with existing query performance analyzer for comprehensive query health scoring.
